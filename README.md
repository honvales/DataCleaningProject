# DataCleaningProject
This project includes my R script submission for the final project of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course

## Project description
The goal of this project is to clean the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The script provides two files: a file (referred as raw in subsequent discussions) including all columns containing mean and standard deviation values of the reported measurements for each activity and user and another file (referred as clean in subsequent discussions) grouping the mean value for each of the columns of the raw dataset by subject and activity.
